<div id ="h3a"> One of the greatest advantages of CAD is its ability to quickly modify and iterate designs. If a designer wants to try a new idea or tweak a dimension, changes can be made in real-time without needing to start from scratch. CAD systems also allow for quick prototyping by converting designs directly into machine-readable code, enabling 3D printing or CNC machining. This accelerates the process of testing and refining concepts before committing to production.
     further more CAD designs are easy to share, allowing for collaboration between teams across different locations. Designers, engineers, and other stakeholders can access, review, and provide feedback on the same digital files. Many CAD platforms also support version control, so multiple revisions can be tracked and managed, ensuring that the team is always working with the most current version of the design. </div>
