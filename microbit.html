<div id ="h2a"> in this project the task was to send a message between two divices using nothing but 2 microbits and microbit code , to complete this task me and a partner had a idea to uses diffrent light 
    levels outputted by one microbit to be read as ethere a 1 or 0 from the other microbit whitch has the ability to read light level . In this way we could use a simple dictonary whitch matches all letters in the 
alpebet , all capital letters and the numbers 0 - 9 to a 6 digit binary code . </div>

<div id ="h3a"> Then we made a code that would translate any sentance into a string of theses 6 digit binary numbers. and from here we could begin the transmition of the message were we 
    used a starting light level whitch would indicate to the reciving microbit a message was about to be sent , after sending the staring message it would begin a loop whitch would go through
    every 1 and 0 in the string of the translated word showing 245 brightness for a 1 and 20 brightness for a 0, whitch the reciving end would understand and store . After the message 
    had been sent the end message would play showing 70 brightness and telling the reciving micro bit to stop checking for 1 and 0. once the message was sent the reciving microbit could then translate it back into understandable letters and numbers by using the same 
    dictionary used to translate it in the first place , it should then output the translated message to the screen . </div>
