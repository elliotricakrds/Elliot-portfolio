        <section id="Content">
            <p>I am currently studying Computer Science A level, Design and Technology A level and Maths A level,  at the Simon Langton Grammar School for Boys. I also performed highly in my GCSEs, notably I achieved a 9 in Computer Science (OCR) and an 8 in Design and Technology (AQA). 
                Furthermore, I already have experience in the digital marketing world, particularly the world of SEO, due to a week of work experience working with the small online business sewyeah.co.uk . I improved the websites Google presence by investigating the commonly searched keywords and adding them to the page's meta descriptions. I am currently developing my understanding of HTML and CSS as I work to create my own portfolio website in Computer Science. In addition to this I am learning Python and can also code in Visual Basic. I am confident using CAD software like Fusion 360 , Onshape and  TechSoft 2D. Additionally, I possess a range of soft skills such as good communication, leadership, working well in a team and working hard to achieve things which have all been developed through
                 my volunteering work with the Kent Wildlife Trust and my five years of playing competitive rugby.</p>
